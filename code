# OTP : Enter the email were u want the otp to get
# later after getting the email enter it below to verify

# Create & use App Passwords
# If you use 2-Step-Verification and get a "password incorrect" error when you sign in, you can try to use an App Password.
#
# Go to your Google Account.
# Select Security.
# Under "Signing in to Google," select App Passwords. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:
# 2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.
# 2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.
# Your account is through work, school, or other organization.
# You turned on Advanced Protection.
# At the bottom, choose Select app and choose the app you using and then Select device and choose the device you’re using and then Generate.
# Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.
# Tap Done.
# Tip: Most of the time, you’ll only have to enter an App Password once per app or device, so don’t worry about memorizing it.
